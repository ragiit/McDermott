                    <strong>10 - Unspeakable pain.</strong> Bedridden and possibly despondent. Very few people will ever experience this level of pain.

                <li>
                    <strong>9 - Excruciating pain.</strong> Unable to converse. Crying out and/or moaning uncontrollably.

                <li>
                    <strong>8 - Intense pain.</strong> Physical activity is severely limited. Conversing requires great effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>7 - Severe pain</strong> that dominates your senses and significantly limits your ability to perform normal daily activities or maintain social relationships. Interferes with sleep.

                <li>
                    <strong>4 - Moderate pain.</strong> If you are deeply involved in an activity, it can be ignored for a period of time, but is still distracting.

                <li>
                    <strong>3 - Pain</strong> is noticeable and distracting, however, you can get used to it and adapt.
